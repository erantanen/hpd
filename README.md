This is an inital experiment in understanding what hex dumps on raw ports looks like.

As I get a bit further, ob I will fill this out more. 


First intresting thing, as you run this code, you will see that all the IP headers start with (?) you'll have to go look.


If you complile with gcc hpd.c you will not see any erros, but if you run this with the make yes you will see errors, it is known.
